#In this challenge, a farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all his animals. The farmer breeds three species:

#chickens = 2 legs
#cows = 4 legs
#dogs = 4 legs

#The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species. You have to implement a script or function that returns the total number of legs of all the animals.

#Example 1
#animals(2, 3, 5) ➞ 36

#Example 2
#input(1, 2, 3) ➞ 22

#Example 3
#How many Chickens? 5
#How many Cows? 2
#How many Dogs? 8
#50 legs

#Create a python script to solve this problem.
